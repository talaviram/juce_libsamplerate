OneShotResample
---------------
This is simple example / testing of the resample API frontend.

It generates a sine in one samplerate and then resamples it to output samplerate.
You can tweak the code to test the SRC.

Requirements:
- Projucer to make the PIP file into a project
- copy/symlink/change your User Modules to include the `juce_libsamplerate` module.
